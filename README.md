# TODD-BOT

Todd is an open-source truth or dare bot for discord, written in C++ using the [D++](https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/DPP) library

### Why?

A server I am a member of was using [this](https://truthordarebot.xyz/) truth or dare bot on their server, but paywalls make my blood boil so I coded my own bot.

Currently we have feature parity with all the non-paywalled features, but I will add in all the features as time goes on.

#### Show me a 10ft wall? I'll show you a 12ft ladder!
